                    In 2023, we launched the "Invisible Battles" campaign, a nationwide initiative that shed light on the challenges faced by women living with chronic conditions such as endometriosis and PCOS. This campaign reached over 50,000 participants and sparked meaningful conversations across social media platforms.

                    In addition, FemHealth spearheaded the Community Wellness Program, providing free health workshops and consultations in underserved areas. This program connected hundreds of women with healthcare professionals, ensuring access to vital resources and support.
